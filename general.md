## General overridden conventions

### Discarding trash

* Trash order chop moves are off
* We discard trash from right-to-left
* Discarding trash out of order is a positional clue on some other player (someone plays a fresh or chop moved card from that slot)

### Certain finesses

* Be careful with certain finesses. If it is reasonable that the clue giver known the identity of their card, don't discard finesse position, but just play it.

### Double ignitions

* We like double ignitions, especially with trash 1s not on chop, but other trash might also work.
* Ignitions are not delayed (unless respecting a delay cannot cost anything).
