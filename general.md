## General overridden conventions

### Discarding trash

* Trash order chop moves are off
* We discard trash from right-to-left
* Discarding trash out of order is a positional clue on some other player (someone plays a fresh or chop moved card from that slot)

### Certain finesses

* Be careful with certain finesses. If it is reasonable that the clue giver known the identity of their card, don't discard finesse position, but just play it.

### Double ignitions

* This may or may not be the official conventions, I'm not too up-to-date to them.
* We like double ignitions, especially with trash 1s not on chop, but other trash might also work.
* Ignitions are not delayed (unless respecting a delay cannot cost anything).
* Unnecessary trash chop moves and unnecessary trash pushes take priority over double ignitions (if they make sense).
